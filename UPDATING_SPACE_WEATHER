The PIM model ionosphere nominally needs some space weather data, which should be stored in
in the files kpf107.dat and IMF24.dat 
The kpf107.dat and IMF24.dat files that need to be updated are stored in the directory
FORTRAN/PIM/PIM_1.7/noaa_dat. After updating the files, remove any empty 'install' file, and
then push the updated data out to the home 'albus' directories with a 'make install' 
command from THIS (ALBUS_ionosphere) top level directory.

To get kpf107.dat updates enter : 
ftp://ftp.gfz-potsdam.de/pub/home/obs/kp-ap/wdc in your browser and get whatever
you need. The data are in the form kpxxyy.wdc, where xx is the year and yy is the month. 
The data are usually a couple of weeks behind the current date. Append the new data to the end 
of the stored kpf107.dat after deleting any repetitive dates. 

WARNING::: as about circa Jan 2018 Potsdam no longer propagates the critical f10.7 numbers.
Otawa still measures them and they can be downloaded from here:
ftp://ftp.seismo.nrcan.gc.ca/spaceweather/solar_flux/daily_flux_values/fluxtable.txt
They need to be filled into character column 66-70 with character column 71 set correctly
see kp_ap.fmt file in the noaa_dat directory. The fluxtable.txt file needs to be pulled manually
and updated using the fluxadjused flux column (which should have the 10000Jy unit -- please check)

http://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/form/dx1.html is the current (2013) site to get IMF24 data. 
See the png image IMF24_request.png in this directory for an example of the fields to be 
selected. After you make your selection click on the 'submit' button at the bottom of
the web page.

It looks like satellite orbit data can be provided quickly from:
ftp igscb.jpl.nasa.gov
cd pub/product/GPS_week ...
