The PIM model ionosphere nominally needs some space weather data, which should be stored in
in the files kpf107.dat and IMF24.dat 
The kpf107.dat and IMF24.dat files that need to be updated are stored in the directory
FORTRAN/PIM/PIM_1.7/noaa_dat. After updating the files, remove any empty 'install' file, and
then push the updated data out to the home 'albus' directories with a 'make install' 
command from THIS (ALBUS_ionosphere) top level directory.

To get kpf107.dat updates enter : 
ftp://ftp.gfz-potsdam.de/pub/home/obs/kp-ap/wdc in your browser and get whatever
you need. The data are in the form kpxxxx.wdc, where xxxx is the year. The data are usually a couple of weeks behind the current date. Append the new data to the end of the stored kpf107.dat after deleting any repetitive dates. 

http://omniweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/form/dx1.html is the current (2013) site to get IMF24 data. 
See the png image IMF24_request.png in this directory for an example of the fields to be selected.

It looks like satellite orbit data can be provided quickly from:
ftp igscb.jpl.nasa.gov
cd pub/product/GPS_week ...
